# Team-A Collaborative Workflow Guidelines

## Repository Setup

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saurabh9001/Team-A.git
   cd Team-A
   ```

2. Set up your personal branch:
   ```bash
   # Switch to your personal branch
   git checkout YOUR_NAME  # e.g., git checkout vivek
   ```

## Workflow for Team Members

### Daily Work Process
1. Always start by updating your branch:
   ```bash
   # Fetch latest changes
   git fetch origin

   # Switch to your branch
   git checkout YOUR_NAME

   # Merge latest changes from main
   git merge origin/main
   ```

2. Create a new feature or fix:
   ```bash
   # Create a descriptive branch for your work
   git checkout -b YOUR_NAME/feature-description
   ```

3. Make and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   # Stage your changes
   git add .

   # Commit with a clear, descriptive message
   git commit -m "Brief description of the change"
   ```

4. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   # Push to your personal branch
   git push origin YOUR_NAME/feature-description
   ```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub
   - Click "Pull requests"
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Select your branch as the compare branch
   - Create the pull request

2. Pull Request Guidelines:
   - Title should be clear and descriptive
   - Provide a detailed description of changes
   - Link any related issues
   - Request a review from team members

### Review and Merge
- At least one team member must review the pull request
- Reviewers should:
  - Check code quality
  - Verify functionality
  - Ensure no conflicts with main branch
- Only merge after approval and all checks pass

## Best Practices
- Communicate with team members
- Keep branches small and focused
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation when making changes
- Avoid pushing directly to main branch
- Resolve merge conflicts collaboratively

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter merge conflicts:
  1. Fetch the latest changes
  2. Merge main into your branch
  3. Resolve conflicts manually
  4. Test thoroughly before pushing

## Communication
- Use GitHub issues for tracking tasks
- Discuss complex changes in team meetings
- Be respectful and constructive in code reviews
